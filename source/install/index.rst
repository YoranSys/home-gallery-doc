Install
=======

HomeGallery has prebuilt binaries for

* `Linux <https://dl.home-gallery.org/dist/latest/home-gallery-latest-linux-x64>`_
* `Mac <https://dl.home-gallery.org/dist/latest/home-gallery-latest-darwin-x64>`_
* `Windows <https://dl.home-gallery.org/dist/latest/home-gallery-latest-win-x64.exe>`_

Other download options can be found `here <https://dl.home-gallery.org/dist>`_.

A prebuilt binary is a command line application and a selfextracting archive.
On the first start it extracts all required files to a temporary directory
and starts the gallery CLI. Please be patient on the first start.
Future starts skip the extraction and the gallery starts faster.

The gallery CLI requires a `gallery.config.yml` configuration file and
it is created if missing. Please read the options and comments for this
configuration file from `GitHub <https://github.com/xemle/home-gallery/blob/master/gallery.config-example.yml>`_.
